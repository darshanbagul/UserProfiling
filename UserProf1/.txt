at pilani campus mélange 2013 – theatre festival at pilani campus 16 october 2013 in a first of its kind,  the humanities and languages department   in association with hindi drama club,  bits pilani organized melange 2013, a theatre festival on 7th-9th october and it featured  some of the best productions in live entertainment and dramatics of today in india. artists included vinay pathak, rajat kapoor, piyush mishra, yashpal sharma and prominent alumni members from national school of drama, delhi.  the festival was organized  with the aim to provide to the students and faculty of the institute, an exposure to the world of professional theatre. program started on 7th october with the lighting of ceremonial lamp by vice chancellor prof b n jain and director, prof. g. raghurama  in the presence of  prof. geetha. b, head, department of humanities and languages, prof. dinesh yadav, professor- in -charge , melange and mr. dayesh jaiswal, coordinator, hindi drama club and other team members.   the spectacle of the evening on 7th was nothing like lear, a performance based on shakespeare’s king lear, directed by bheja fry fame rajat kapoor, featuring single act by dasvidaniya and bheja fry fame vinay pathak. almost two thousand awestruck audience in the jam packed auditorium witnessed a hilarious interpretation of shakespeare's greatest tragedy ever. with a liberal mix of mime, stand-up and spoof, the one-man-show brought out the anguish of a father mingled with his love for his daughter.  following the performance, there was a talk in the ltc by director rajat kapoor  and mr vinay pathak and lively discussion followed.    day two featured yaar bana buddy, a play studded with the protagonist yashpal sharma and famous theatre contemporaries sajjad khan and chinmay das. this rib tickling masterpiece by sahitya natak akademi award recipient, nadira zaheer babbar was a light hearted look at the life of three childhood friends from a modest background who have climbed the social ladder. it transported the audience to their growing years. the play celebrated indian-ness, friendship, forgiveness, values and our ability to laugh. funny, yet touching theme. it was a satisfying moment for the organizers when nadira babbar, at the end of the play, pointed out how this festival is first of its kind where a technical university was organizing a festival of this magnitude in arts.   on the last day mr. piyush mishra, actor, singer, lyricist and music director well known for gangs of wasseypur and rockstar touched the hearts of bitsians. he struck an immediate chord with the audience with his rendition of  o re duniay from anuarag kashyap  film gulaal.  his soulful renderings of compositions from theatre and films including o husna left the audience wanting more .  the festival ended with the play,  saiyaan bhaye kotwal by the theatre group “theatrewaalas ”. based on the famous marathi play it was a story of a king and his scheming prime minister. the play's slapstick comedy brought out the political undercurrents of nepotism and urged the audience to relate with current political scenario.      this theatre festival was a unique initiative from the department to explore avenues in liberal studies. such close interaction with the famous artists was very inspiring for the theatre enthusiasts. the theatre extravaganza was  coordinated by dayesh jaswal and directed by prof. dinesh yadav and prof. geetha. b from the department of humanities and languages.   swayambhu foundation, a prominent name in the field of arts and dramatics,  curated the festival.    “thank you bits pilani! the most lovely audience! the most electric! hence the most humbling experience! ! ! thank u thank u thank u !!!”  - tweets theater and film actor vinay pathak…   "the coming together of technology and art is a great concept…ye apne aap me hi ek badi behtarin aur khushgawar baat he ki ek technology ke instiutute me ek art festival ho raha he aur wo bhi theatre ke upar." - nadira zaheer babbar at the end of the second day of the festival    for more information, click here:
